# App Flow Document for Real Estate Monitoring Service

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a brand-new user or the service owner first accesses the application, they are greeted with a clear landing page. Even though the service is built primarily as a personal monitoring tool, a simple sign-up process is available for account creation. A new user enters their email address and a password to register. The sign-up process is straightforward with clear prompts for each step and includes an option for social logins if the user prefers. In case the user forgets their password, there is an accessible password recovery page that guides them through verifying their email and resetting the password. Once registered, the system offers an intuitive sign-in page where the user inputs their credentials to log into the application. A sign-out option is also available, ensuring that the user can securely end their session at any time.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After a successful sign-in, the user is taken to the main dashboard of the application. This page acts as the hub for all monitoring activities. The default view shows a simple interface with a header describing the service and a navigation menu that details the main sections. Within this page, the user sees a quick overview of the latest status of the service, including when the last check was conducted and the number of new listings found. The layout is clean with clear sections for starting a manual monitoring process, accessing logs of previous runs, and viewing any error notifications. The user can easily navigate to each part of the application through clear links on the page and can initiate additional tasks if needed.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
The core feature of the application is its ability to monitor the ss.com real estate listings. Every day at a scheduled time of 6 am EET, a background process is triggered to start the monitoring workflow. The process automatically constructs the URL for the main listing page and builds URLs for paginated pages up to a default of ten pages. As the service navigates through each page, it retrieves the HTML content and parses it to extract key real estate details, such as the posting date, address, number of rooms, square meters, floor count, price per square meter, and total price. After extracting the details, a filtering algorithm runs to determine if the listings match the owner’s criteria. Listings that meet the criteria—like the minimum required number of rooms or specific price ranges—are retained. Extra information such as images or additional descriptions is also gathered if available. Once all pages are processed, the service aggregates the qualifying listings and formats them into a detailed summary. This summary is designed to include every pertinent detail along with a direct link to view each listing on ss.com. The user journey flows seamlessly from schedule-triggered execution to data fetching, pagination handling, filtering based on defined parameters and finally to the preparation and sending of the email summary using Resend. The transitions between the automatic background task and the optional manual trigger from the dashboard are smooth and keep the user informed of each step in the process.

## Settings and Account Management
The account management section allows the user to view and update their personal information and adjust their notification settings if desired. Even though the service runs primarily without a database and uses static criteria, there is a simple settings page where the user can update the email address where the daily summary is sent, change the password, and view account details. In this section, the user can also specify configuration options such as the number of pages to be paginated through from ss.com, with a default of ten pages and an option to change it if the user’s needs evolve. Once any changes are saved, the user is redirected back to the main dashboard where the updated settings are immediately in effect for future monitoring tasks.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
In the event that the application encounters any issues such as invalid input data, connectivity problems, or changes in the ss.com website structure, the system has built-in error handling. If an error arises during the fetching or parsing of data, a friendly error message is displayed either on the dashboard or as a pop-up notification. In cases where the service fails to retrieve data from a paginated page or if the website structure has unexpectedly changed, the error is logged and a notification is sent to the user via email or within the dashboard interface. This ensures that the user is informed immediately of potential issues and can take steps to troubleshoot, such as adjusting the configuration or checking the Resend error alerts. Despite these interruptions, the system is designed to safely guide the user back to the normal operational flow after the error is acknowledged or resolved.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the initial sign-up and sign-in to the comprehensive daily monitoring of real estate listings, the user journey is designed to be simple and effective. The user begins with a straightforward onboarding process, proceeds to the main dashboard where key information is readily available, and then trusts the fully automated background process to scrape listings, filter them based on defined criteria, and compile a detailed summary. The integration with Resend makes sure that the summary email, which contains all the important details and direct links to the listings, reaches the user reliably at 6 am EET every day. Each part of the application is connected by clear page transitions and user feedback, ensuring that even when errors occur, the user is promptly informed and guided back into the normal flow of operations. Overall, the service provides a seamless one-stop experience to stay updated with the latest real estate opportunities on ss.com.
